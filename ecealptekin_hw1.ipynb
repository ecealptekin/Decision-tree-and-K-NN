In this task train data splitted %70 for training %30 for validating. When I train dataset with default parameters, I get the result : Testing Accuracy = 67.63285%. Shuffling the data before splitting make accuracy score higher and we get better results. These two algorithms take parameters. In k-nn algorithm , the k is different for each data set. Therefore, we cannot set the k value as a constant. In this task I tried the key values, which are odd and between 1 and 30. When k=9,the score is 71.01449%. This k value gives the best score.\n",
